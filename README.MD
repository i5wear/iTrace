## To Use

Basically, it just works like how Ninjabrain Bot does.

However, there's only a simple command user interface.

Do F3+C and paste, or do the following commands to use:

`CHECK` - Check all the data input.

`CLEAR` - Clear all the data input.

`VER 1.<N> ` - Set the MC version with the given number.

`CAL <Seed>` - Start calibration with the given world seed.

`ERR <Mean> <Sigma>` - Set the eye error distribution.

`ADD <X> <Z> <Yaw> ` - Add a less accurate eye of ender.

## Notes

Do `CLEAR` to stop calibration.

F3+C grants better accuracy than `ADD`.

Boat throw is not planned to support.
