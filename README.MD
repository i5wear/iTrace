## To Use

Basically, it works like how Ninjabrain Bot does.

Do F3+C and paste, or do the commands to use:

`CHECK` - Check all the data input.

`CLEAR` - Clear all the data input.

`VER 1.<N> ` - Set the MC version with given *N*.

`CAL <Seed>` - Start calibration with given seed.

`ERR <Mean> <Sigma>` - Set the error distribution.

`ADD <X> <Z> <Yaw> ` - Add an eye measurement.

## Notes

Do `CLEAR` or `CAL 0` to stop calibration.

F3+C should be used in favor of `ADD`.

Enter with nothing to exit program.
